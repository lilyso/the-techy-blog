## Project Status

Project is: _in progress_ 

## Room for Improvement

- Design could be improved with containers and styling to separate sections on website. For example, how comments are displayed under article.
- Design could be improved for forms.

To do:

- Add a Handlbars Helper to replace line breaks so that paragraphs can be rendered. Currently, new blog posts are stored with no paragraph breaks and are rendered in one paragraph.
- Add option to upload images in blog. 
- Add more content
